# Bryt Designs Tech Challenge

### Shopify Product Review App

### Hello fellow candidate! ðŸ‘‹

###### Today's challenge is to build a product review app in Shopify. The project uses Remix/Reactjs, Polaris and Shopify's Admin Graphql API. The app design will be broken up into several different parts, which we will get into shortly ðŸ˜Ž!

### Why a Product Review app?

###### We believe this is the best challenge to demonstrate your technical skills, problem solving and knowledge of Javascript Frameworks, Shopify, and Graphql.

### What's the goal of this challenge? âš½

###### I'm glad you asked! We want to get an understanding of your abilities by measuring how readable your code is, how you approach problems and your attention to detail.

### What's the process like?

###### Well, you should have received the resources ahead of time, to get an idea of the resources you'll need to build a Product Review app in Shopify. You'll have at most a day to build out the app. Feel free to spend as much OR as little time to complete this challenge. Once you're confident you've completed the challenge, please submit your repo via email for review.

#### Challenge Goals

- [ ] When the app is accessed through the admin menu, the user must be able to see all the reviews tied to each individual product.
- [ ] There should be a way for a customer to add a review to a product through the product page.
  - [ ] Modify the ["review-embed"](extensions/review-embed) to create the ui for adding a review to a product from a product page.
  - [ ] Create a [proxy endpoint](app/routes/api.public.$/route.tsx). This endpoint should receive reviews from the "review-embed" extension and apply the reviews to the associated products.
- [ ] A review must a least keep track of the star rating and a message provided by the customer. Whatever other data you store and how you store the review is entirely up to you.

##### Extras (Not required)!

- [ ] The review-embed should only allow products to be reviewed, if a customer is signed in and if the customer has reviewed the product before.
- [ ] A way to sort the reviews of a product by rating.
- [ ] A theme app extension for rendering all the reviews for a product on a product page.
- [ ] A theme app extension for rendering the star rating of a product.
- [ ] A way to search though reviews for specific keywords.
- [ ] A way for an admin to approve or disapprove reviews, which will determine whether or not the listed review appears on the site.
- [ ] A way for the customer to edit a review.
